# CI/CD Implementation Summary

## ✅ Implementation Complete

The CI/CD pipeline has been successfully implemented for the WSX Framework monorepo. Here's what has been set up:

## 🛠️ Tools Installed

### Dependencies Added
- **semantic-release** - Automated versioning and publishing
- **@semantic-release/git** - Git integration for version commits
- **@semantic-release/github** - GitHub releases
- **@semantic-release/changelog** - Automated changelog generation
- **@semantic-release/exec** - Custom command execution
- **@commitlint/cli** - Commit message validation
- **@commitlint/config-conventional** - Conventional commit rules

## 📋 Configuration Files Created

### 1. `.releaserc.js` - Semantic Release Configuration
- Automated version bumping based on conventional commits
- Monorepo package publishing (excluding examples)
- Changelog generation
- GitHub release creation
- Git commit automation

### 2. `.commitlintrc.js` - Commit Message Validation
- Enforces conventional commit format
- Package-specific scopes (core, vite-plugin, eslint-plugin, etc.)
- Validates commit types (feat, fix, docs, etc.)
- Character limits and formatting rules

### 3. `.husky/commit-msg` - Git Hook
- Automatically validates commit messages on commit
- Prevents non-conventional commits from being created

## 🔄 GitHub Actions Workflows

### 1. `.github/workflows/pr.yml` - PR Validation
**Triggers**: PRs to develop branch
**Jobs**:
- **commitlint** - Validates all commit messages in PR
- **lint** - ESLint and Prettier checks
- **typecheck** - TypeScript compilation
- **test** - Jest tests with coverage
- **build** - Package builds on Node 16, 18, 20
- **coverage-report** - Posts coverage comment to PR

### 2. `.github/workflows/release.yml` - Release Pipeline
**Triggers**: Push to main branch
**Jobs**:
- **ci** - Full CI validation
- **build-matrix** - Build/test on multiple Node versions
- **release** - Semantic release to NPM and GitHub

### 3. `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Daily CI (Updated)
**Triggers**: Push to develop + daily cron
**Jobs**: Continuous integration on develop branch

## 🔒 Security and Secrets

### Required GitHub Secrets
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` - Automatic (GitHub provides this)
- `NPM_TOKEN` - Needs to be added for NPM publishing

### NPM Token Setup
1. Generate token at https://www.npmjs.com/settings/tokens
2. Add as repository secret: `NPM_TOKEN`
3. Ensure token has publish permissions for `@wsxjs` scope

## 📊 Coverage and Quality

### Coverage Reporting
- **Threshold**: 80% minimum coverage
- **PR Comments**: Detailed coverage report posted to PRs
- **Codecov Integration**: Coverage uploaded to codecov.io
- **Failure Conditions**: PR fails if coverage drops below threshold

### Quality Gates
- All ESLint rules must pass
- Prettier formatting enforced
- TypeScript compilation without errors
- All tests must pass
- Coverage threshold met
- Conventional commit messages required

## 🌳 Branch Strategy

### Branch Flow
```
feature/xyz → develop → main → NPM Release
```

### Branch Protection (To Be Configured)
- **develop**: Require PR reviews + all status checks
- **main**: Require 2 approvals + all status checks
- **Status checks**: lint, typecheck, test, build, coverage-report

## 📦 Release Process

### Automatic Version Bumping
- `feat:` → **MINOR** version (0.1.0 → 0.2.0)
- `fix:` → **PATCH** version (0.1.0 → 0.1.1)
- `feat!:` or `BREAKING CHANGE:` → **MAJOR** version (0.1.0 → 1.0.0)

### Release Workflow
1. **Push to main** triggers release
2. **Analyze commits** since last release
3. **Determine version bump** from commit types
4. **Update package.json** files
5. **Build packages**
6. **Run tests**
7. **Publish to NPM**
8. **Create GitHub release**
9. **Update CHANGELOG.md**

## 🎯 NPM Publishing

### Package Publishing
- **Scope**: `@wsxjs`
- **Packages**: core, vite-plugin, eslint-plugin
- **Excludes**: examples (development only)
- **Registry**: https://registry.npmjs.org
- **Access**: Public

### Version Synchronization
- All packages bump version together
- Workspace dependencies automatically updated
- Consistent versioning across monorepo

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Repository Setup
- ✅ GitHub repository: `wsxjs/wsxjs`
- Add NPM_TOKEN secret
- Configure branch protection rules

### 2. First Release
- Push to main branch
- Verify automatic release works
- Check NPM packages are published

### 3. Team Onboarding
- Document conventional commit guidelines
- Set up development environment
- Train on PR workflow

## 📝 Usage Commands

### Local Development
```bash
# Test semantic-release (dry run)
pnpm release:dry

# Manual release (local testing)
pnpm release

# Run full CI locally
pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck && pnpm test && pnpm build
```

### Conventional Commits Examples
```bash
# New feature
git commit -m "feat(core): add new jsx factory function"

# Bug fix
git commit -m "fix(vite-plugin): resolve auto-import issue"

# Breaking change
git commit -m "feat(core)!: remove deprecated logger methods"

# Documentation
git commit -m "docs: update README with new installation steps"
```

## 📈 Success Metrics

### Short-term Goals
- ✅ Automated releases working
- ✅ All tests passing in CI
- ✅ Coverage reporting active
- ✅ Conventional commits enforced

### Long-term Goals
- 95%+ CI success rate
- Weekly release cadence
- 100% conventional commit compliance
- Growing NPM download metrics

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **NPM Token**: Ensure token has correct permissions
2. **Coverage Fails**: Check coverage threshold (80%)
3. **Commit Messages**: Follow conventional commit format
4. **Build Errors**: Verify all packages build successfully

### Debugging Commands
```bash
# Check semantic-release config
npx semantic-release --dry-run

# Validate commit message
npx commitlint --from=HEAD~1 --to=HEAD --verbose

# Check coverage
pnpm test:coverage
```

## 🎉 Implementation Status: COMPLETE

All CI/CD components have been successfully implemented and are ready for use once the GitHub repository is created and secrets are configured.
